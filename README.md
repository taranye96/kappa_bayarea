This repository contains the main code used in the Nye et al. paper on Kappa in the San Francisco BayArea. 

The code is organized in the subdirectories as follows:

- processing: scrips used to process the data before solving for kappa
- kappa: scripts used to compute estiamtes of kappa and k0
- krige: scripts used to make the inerpolated map of kappa
- geo_analysis: scripts used in the analysis of k0 vs surficial geology
- site_residuals: scripts used to compute the GMM site residuals
